For bootstrap.R and extract.R:
Furthermore, we designed a simple ML bootstrap procedure that estimates phylogenetic uncertainty stemming also from uncertainty about the alignment itself.
Using an R script, full alignments were generated by randomly selecting one of the 400 alternative GUIDANCE2 alignments for each of the ITS1, ITS2, nrLSU,
and mrSSU and concatenating them with the fixed alignments of 5.8S and RPB1. IQ-TREE was called from within the script to generate a single standard
non-parametric bootstrap replicate, for simplicity using the unpartitioned model (SYM+I+Î“). This process was repeated 1000 times and a consensus tree was
generated from the resulting trees.
