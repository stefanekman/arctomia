This folder contains (1) a table with voucher information on the unsequenced specimens used for classification in the machine learning process, and (2) an R script and three tables that work as a key translating the specimen working names we used for the analyses to the names appearing in the paper. Using the script and the tables, any text file (table, tree etc.) in this repository can be translated to apply the specimen names in the paper.
