This folder contains (1) a table with voucher information for the production set (=unseen data, here unsequenced specimens) used for classification in the machine learning process (additional_data) along with a FASTA file containing a partial ITS1 from a specimen of Arctomia confusa (S F145725) long enough for identificatio but too short to submit to GenBank, and (2) an R script and three tables that work as a key translating the specimen working names we used for the analyses to the names appearing in the paper (keys). Using the script and the tables, any text file (table, tree etc.) in this repository can be translated to apply the specimen names in the paper.
