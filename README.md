# Arctomia

This is the GitHub repository 'Arctomia' accompanying the paper Ekman, S., Svensson, M. & Westberg, M. 2025: 'Probabilistic inference of species boundaries and type affiliations in the lichen genus Arctomia (Arctomiaceae, Ascomycota)' in Taxon 74: XXXâ€“XXX. This respository contains all data, including alignments, trees not illustrated, morphological data, as well as all R and Python scripts found in that paper.

Data and scripts should be more or less self-explanatory from the names of folders and files. When this is not the case, a README.md file has been added to provide the necessary information to understand the data and scripts in order to reproduce the results.

Note that the dates found in the R and Python scripts in no way reflect the dates when the analyses were performed. A date in a script rather correspond to the date when the script was tidied up and properly documented.
