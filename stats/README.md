The script EDA.R inputs raw measurements from individual apothecia and ascospores in the file 'measurements.txt' and outputs an Excel file with descriptive statistics. The input file contains empty cells because of an unequal number of measurements per specimen for the three characters.

In addition to the measurements in the file 'measurements.txt', the dominating number of septa per ascospore was also recorded for each specimen. This information can be found in the file 'arctomia_morph.txt' found in the three machine learning folders LRL2, autogluon, and hyperfast.
